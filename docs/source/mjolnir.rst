What is Mjolnir?
=====
Mjölnir is a computing cluster purchased by a group of PI’s from the Globe Institute located at the University of Copenhagen. 
Only employees of or collaborators to the PI's can get access to Mjolnir.

The cluster is maintained by:
`Bent Petersen (bent.petersen@sund.ku.dk) <https://globe.ku.dk/staff-list/hologenomics/?id=271131&vis=medarbejder>`_ and `Thomas Sicheritz-Pontén (thomassp@sund.ku.dk) <https://globe.ku.dk/staff-list/hologenomics/?pure=en/persons/635914>`_.

What does Mjolnir mean??
*****

Mjölnir (or Mjolnir for non-danish keyboards) is the `hammer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mj%C3%B6lnir>`_ of the thunder god `Thor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor>`_ in `Norse mythology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology>`_, used both as a devastating weapon and as a divine instrument to provide blessings.

The naming of our HPC-infrastructure came to life as we will be using Mjolnir to **hammer big data to solve small research questions**. Thank you Tom for the excellent naming!

Where is Mjolnir located?
*****

Mjolnir is physically located at the Panum computing center. This means that all Mjolnirs servers are integrated into the KU-IT infrastructure with all their security measures applied.

This also means that you can only access Mjolnir via VPN and **only** using Cisco AnyConnect downloaded from https://vpn.ku.dk. Furthermore, only Globe associated users will be able to use Mjolnir. Check out the :doc:`vpn` section for further information.

Is Mjolnir similar to any other HPC?
*****
In short – yes, but as Mjolnir is built from scratch in early 2022, there will not be the rich history of installed software, yet. We are working very hard to change that.
Notice, if you have been using other HPC’s before, you will need to re-adjust your scripts as the physical servers has a different setup at Mjolnir (see more in :doc:`architecture_hardware`), compared to what you have been using before. This is very important for correct utilization of resources and fair-share with your colleagues.
