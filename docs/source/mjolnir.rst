What is Mjolnir?
=====
Mjolnir is a computing cluster purchased by a group of PI’s from the Globe Institute located at the University of Copenhagen. 
Only employees of or collaborators to the PI's can get access to Mjolnir.

The cluster is maintained by:
`Bent Petersen (bent.petersen@sund.ku.dk) <https://globe.ku.dk/staff-list/hologenomics/?id=271131&vis=medarbejder>`_ and `Thomas Sicheritz-Pontén (thomassp@sund.ku.dk) <https://globe.ku.dk/staff-list/hologenomics/?pure=en/persons/635914>`_.

What does Mjolnir mean??
*****

Mjölnir is the hammer of the thunder god Thor in Norse mythology, used both as a devastating weapon and as a divine instrument to provide blessings.

We use Mjolnir to **hammer big data to solve small research questions**. Thank you Tom for the excellent naming!

Where is Mjolnir located?
*****

Mjolnir is physically located at the Panum computing center. This means that it is integrated into the KU-IT infrastructure with all their security measures applied.

This also means that you can only access Mjolnir via VPN and **only** using Cisco AnyConnect downloaded from https://vpn.ku.dk. Furthermore, only Globe associated users will be able to use Mjolnir. Check out the :doc:`vpn` section for further information.

Is Mjolnir similar to any other HPC?
*****
In short – yes, but Mjolnir is built from scratch so there will not be the rich history of installed software.
Also, if you have been using other HPC’s before, you will need to re-adjust your scripts as the physical servers has a different setup at Mjolnir (see more in :doc:`architecture_hardware`). This is very important for correct utilization of resources and fair-share with your colleagues.
