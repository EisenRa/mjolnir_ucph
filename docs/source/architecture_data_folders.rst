Architecture: Data folders
====


Project/data folders
*****
When you are working at Mjolnir there are some folders you need to be aware of.

    .. code-block:: console

      /home/<KU-ID>
This is your home directory. You are not suppoose to store any data here, and you therefore only have a 10GB storage limit


    .. code-block:: console

        /projects/mjolnir1/people/<KU-ID>

This is where you should store all your data. It is important to keep your storage as low as possible to reduce cost. Delete files you no longer need. You can calculate your total storage in any given directory incl. subfolders by typing: **ncdu**

Compress (e.g. gzip, bzip2) large files/folders and finished projects.
Upload finished project data (Raw data/results/notes etc) to ERDA


Databases
*****

Databases can be stored in a common folder for access to everyone.

    .. code-block:: console

        /projects/mjolnir1/data/databases

This is where commonly used databases will be stored. Contact Bent for storing of databases. The folder is not user-maintained.
