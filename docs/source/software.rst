Software
=====

Software can be loaded in two ways: using a Conda environment or loaded as a module.
For most users, loading the software as a module is the preferred way to work.

Conda Environments
-----
Version specific conda environments can be located in:

.. code-block:: console

   /projects/mjolnir1/apps/conda/software-version
   
If you want to activate the Conda environment ``bwa version 0.7.17`` you simply type:

.. code-block:: console

   conda activate /projects/mjolnir1/apps/conda/bwa-0.7.17

When you are finished using the software and want to deactivate it, you type:

.. code-block:: console

   conda deactivate

For more information in using ``conda environments`` please refer to:
`Conda userguide <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html>`_
