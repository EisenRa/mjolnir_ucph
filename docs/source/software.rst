Software
=====

Software can be loaded in two ways: using Conda environment or load as module

Conda Environments
-----
Version specific conda environments can be located in:

.. code-block:: console

   /projects/mjolnir1/apps/conda/software-version
   
If you want to load ``bwa version 0.7.17`` you simply type

.. code-block:: console

   conda activate /projects/mjolnir1/apps/conda/bwa-0.7.17

For more information in using ``conda environments``, please refer to: `Conda userguide <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html)>`
